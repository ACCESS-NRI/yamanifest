CHANGES
=======

0.3.5
-----

* Support multiple fullpaths

0.3.4
-----

* Fixed new test

0.3.3
-----

* Added support for multiple fullpaths which is required for multiple files support
* Added CHANGELOG and AUTHORS
* Fixed gitignore syntax
* Added some test data files to gitignore

0.3.2
-----

* Changed to README.rst in setup
* Fixed up some conda install bits n bobs
* Added optional fullpath option to add(), to support specifying a path other than the result of path.relpath
* Could not guarantee add() was traversing hash functions in the correct order when they were specified as arguments. This led to short circuit choosing the incorrect hash with python27. In the case of python3 the test passed
* Changed default numproc to use all available CPUs
* Added multiprocessing to add() and check() to improve speed
* New update() function. Updates one manifest from the contents of another based on filepath
* Added utils.py with find\_files utility
* Changed update function to update\_matching\_hashes, to better reflect it's function, and allow for a new update function
* Improved test for add() by testing case where no filepaths specified
* add() now accepts list of filepaths. Added test
* Better reporting of hash errors in yamf
* Fixed check\_file to properly return hashes. Removed cruft in check\_file
* Simplified return statement from check()

0.3.1
-----

* Removed non-deterministic test
* Added multiprocessing support to check\_file()
* Intermediate stage of refactor. Passes test but no multiprocessing
* More useful error output in yamf.py
* Fixed bug. Hashing needs to occur on fullpath, otherwise nchash is wrong
* Can now chain a load() to class instantiation. Added test

0.3.0
-----

* Fixed test being performed in incorrect directory
* Changed yamanifest format to include header with metadata by having two YaML documents in the file. This means it is possible to check if the file is a valid yamanifest, which might be difficult otherwise as any yaml file will be loaded without complaint

0.2.6
-----

* Noop committo force circleci rebuild

0.2.5
-----

* Refactored add() so that it does not save paths which do not contain a valid hash
* Enclose hashing in try/except block and return None for unhashable paths (like directories)
* Corrected circleci to point to coecms organisation

0.2.4.2
-------

* Removed pypi deployment

0.2.4.1
-------

* Trying to get pypi deploy to work. Commented out repo

0.2.4
-----

* Added pypi deploy to travis
* Made shortcircuit option for add + tests

0.2.3
-----

* Added \_\_len\_\_ function to Manifest class. Added test for len()

0.2.2
-----

* Add coecms channel to circle config
* Removed ncchash from meta.yaml conda requirements
* Removed tab indentation in meta.yaml
* Added conda dependencies for CircleCI
* Added actual shortcircuit test
* Cleaned up shortcircuit logic in check\_file. Probably an undocumented bug in the return code logic
* Changed to subparser for yamf
* Added yamf test
* Pass fullpath to hash calculation function. When there were two levels of symbolic link the file could not be found
* Added cli interface (yamf). Can create and check manifests
* Supplying a hash function is now optional. Use defaults if not supplied
* Changed all the manifest file names to something more systematic and reflecting best practise: now have .yaml suffix
* Made import cleaner by adding \_\_init\_\_.py imports
* Updated nchash import requires more recent version
* Print python version information to test stdout for verification
* Used cleaner import syntax for nchash
* Change nchash dependency
* Using updated nchash, catching not netCDF file format errors and silently ignoring. Allows for easy specification of a hash hierarchy
* Added check method to check all filepaths
* Changed API to more generic and understandable method names
* Added class methods for checking if a path exists, and if a hash function exists for that path, and tests
* Specified higher version of nchash: fixed again
* Specified higher version of nchash: fixed
* Specified higher version of nchash
* Updated travis build environment for dependencies
* Updated README

0.2.1
-----

* Removed codeclimate badge

0.2
---

* Removed landscape badge from README
* Simplified manifest format. File paths are now top level in the manifest dictionary
* Added missing test files
* Working version with some testing
* Initial working version. Opted for flat structure with complex data structure over classes, which would require translating back and forwards to YAML compatible complex data structure
* Initial commit from cookie cutter output
