CHANGES
=======

0.3.1
-----

* Removed non-deterministic test
* Added multiprocessing support to check\_file()
* Intermediate stage of refactor. Passes test but no multiprocessing
* More useful error output in yamf.py
* Fixed bug. Hashing needs to occur on fullpath, otherwise nchash is wrong
* Can now chain a load() to class instantiation. Added test

0.3.0
-----

* Fixed test being performed in incorrect directory
* Changed yamanifest format to include header with metadata by having two YaML documents in the file. This means it is possible to check if the file is a valid yamanifest, which might be difficult otherwise as any yaml file will be loaded without complaint

0.2.6
-----

* Noop committo force circleci rebuild

0.2.5
-----

* Refactored add() so that it does not save paths which do not contain a valid hash
* Enclose hashing in try/except block and return None for unhashable paths (like directories)
* Corrected circleci to point to coecms organisation

0.2.4.2
-------

* Removed pypi deployment

0.2.4.1
-------

* Trying to get pypi deploy to work. Commented out repo

0.2.4
-----

* Added pypi deploy to travis
* Made shortcircuit option for add + tests

0.2.3
-----

* Added \_\_len\_\_ function to Manifest class. Added test for len()

0.2.2
-----

* Add coecms channel to circle config
* Removed ncchash from meta.yaml conda requirements
* Removed tab indentation in meta.yaml
* Added conda dependencies for CircleCI
* Added actual shortcircuit test
* Cleaned up shortcircuit logic in check\_file. Probably an undocumented bug in the return code logic
* Changed to subparser for yamf
* Added yamf test
* Pass fullpath to hash calculation function. When there were two levels of symbolic link the file could not be found
* Added cli interface (yamf). Can create and check manifests
* Supplying a hash function is now optional. Use defaults if not supplied
* Changed all the manifest file names to something more systematic and reflecting best practise: now have .yaml suffix
* Made import cleaner by adding \_\_init\_\_.py imports
* Updated nchash import requires more recent version
* Print python version information to test stdout for verification
* Used cleaner import syntax for nchash
* Change nchash dependency
* Using updated nchash, catching not netCDF file format errors and silently ignoring. Allows for easy specification of a hash hierarchy
* Added check method to check all filepaths
* Changed API to more generic and understandable method names
* Added class methods for checking if a path exists, and if a hash function exists for that path, and tests
* Specified higher version of nchash: fixed again
* Specified higher version of nchash: fixed
* Specified higher version of nchash
* Updated travis build environment for dependencies
* Updated README

0.2.1
-----

* Removed codeclimate badge

0.2
---

* Removed landscape badge from README
* Simplified manifest format. File paths are now top level in the manifest dictionary
* Added missing test files
* Working version with some testing
* Initial working version. Opted for flat structure with complex data structure over classes, which would require translating back and forwards to YAML compatible complex data structure
* Initial commit from cookie cutter output
